# DEBS 2020 GC
This project came to live in the framework of my Master's Thesis at @ TU Munich which was rewarded with a M.Sc. Information Systems in November 2020.
Due to time constraints this solution was never submitted officially. However, the performance metrics revealed substantial potential of pairing Barsim et. al's 
approach with reactive programming, precisely ReactiveX.

If you are interested in the outcomes (metrics, concept, background information, etc.) please get in touch.
A detailed code explanation is not included in this code for better readability, but is available on request.
